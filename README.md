🌐 API Reference
This app uses the PokeAPI:

GET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{id}
Replace {id} with a random number between 1 and 1000.

✨ How It Works
When the button is clicked, a random number is generated.

That number is used to fetch data from the PokeAPI.

The response is parsed to extract:

Name of the Pokemon

Image (official artwork)

Moves list (full list)

Data is displayed dynamically in the UI.
